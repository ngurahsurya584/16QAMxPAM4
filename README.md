I try to make Pulse Amplitude Modulation 4 levels and 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation with python language. I still leaning more about how exactly how it works 

There are 7 files in this repo which the first file you need to focus on is the "env_ngurah.yml". this file contains library that I used to develop this project. to install using this file, you need to install miniconda3, which provided in link below:
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

For the convenience, you can run the file using vscode and install the jupyter notebook extension.

cheerss :)
